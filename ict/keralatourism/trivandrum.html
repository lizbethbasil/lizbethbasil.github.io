It is known for its calm beaches, backwaters, hill stations, and rich culture because of which it attracts several Indian as well as foreign tourists. It is one of the cleanest and calm cities in India.</p>
          <p>Thiruvananthapuram, also known by its former name Trivandrum is the capital of the Indian state of Kerala. It is the most populous city in Kerala with a population of 957,730 as of 2011. The encompassing urban agglomeration population is around 1.68 million. Located on the west coast of India near the extreme south of the mainland, Thiruvananthapuram is a major information technology hub in Kerala and contributes 55% of the state's software exports as of 2016. Referred to by Mahatma Gandhi as the "Evergreen city of India".</p>
          <p>The city’s name Trivandrum is originated from “Tiru,” “Anantha,” and “Puram,” which means “Lord Anantha’s kingdom.” Trivandrum was ruled by the Ays till the 10th century A.D., according to traditions and history. The Ays lost power, and the city was taken over by Venad’s rulers. During the reign of Umayamma Rani in 1684, the East India Company attempted to establish authority at Anchuthengu on the sea coast about 32 kilometers north of Thiruvananthapuram.</p>
          <p>However, Trivandrum entered the historical spotlight only with Marathanda Varma, recognized as the Father of Modern Travancore (1729-1758 AD). It was only during his reign that the palace became a prominent center of intellectual and artistic pursuits. During the reign of Maharaja Swathi Thiruna, there was significant cultural and economic advancement following Marathanda Varman. Around 1834, English education began to spread. The Shri Moolam Assembly was established in 1904. During the reign of Shri Moolam Thirunal, the activities of the Indian National Congress were heard in Thiruvananthapuram and other parts of Kerala.</p>
